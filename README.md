Stamps a standard comment header onto every source file in a folder.

> ⚠️ This rewrites files in place. Commit or back up first.

## Install

```sh
dart pub global activate df_generate_header_comments
```

## Use

Create a `header_template.md` with the header you want stamped:

````md
```dart
// The use of this source code is governed by the LICENSE file located in this
// project's root directory.
```
````

From the target folder, run:

```sh
df_generate_header_comments --headers -t path/to/header_template.md
```

A [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dev-Cetera.dev-cetera-df-support-commands) is also available — right-click a folder and pick `🔹 Generate Header Comments`.
